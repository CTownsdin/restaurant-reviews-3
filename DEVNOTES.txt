---MobX Notes-----------------------------
@inject('MyStore')    works with the provider component, and decorates your
  react component class, to put the store on the props.
@observer   decorates your react component class such that it will dynamically
  update with changes to mobx state
to use an action as defined within the store class, simply access the store.action
  from props
@observable marks the state which should be observed
@computed get FUNCTION    is a get fn defn inside the mobx store class and
  it is used like a property within your react component
<Provider /> component is imported from mob-react of course, and is given the store
  as a prop, and then wraps the <AppMain /> component, and then thru react context
  it provides the mobx store to all the child components.
  In a CRA app, this is customarily handled in the src/index.js file.
A store name should be capitalized, for ex  MyStore.
------------------------------------------
[x] fetch restaurants in the componentDidMount
Plan-Idea: do most of the css inline for this project.

---^^^-DONE-^^^---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----TODO: NEXT --------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOAL: Make the 'All Areas' and 'All Cuisines' selectors work.
[] populate the selectors with the selections
PLAN:  onSelection, call @actions defn'd within mobx store which
  change the selected value
  [] Move the selectors into the restaurants container.

  
utils.js
function fetchRestaurantByCuisine(cuisine, callback) {
and the other similar fns

  [] created an observeable state called RestaurantsFilteredSelection
  [] create actions which change what is in RestaurantsFilteredSelection
  [] display the RestaurantsFilteredSelection list in the view


Clean Up the JS files and bundles, which are still needed?  remove the rest.
